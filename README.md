# Volcano Eruption Modelling Using Blender

Here are the concise steps for setting up and running the Blender project on volcano eruption:
1. Download Software: Install the latest version of Blender (3.0 or newer). (Link: https://www.blender.org/download/)
2. Clone Project: Clone your GitHub repository containing the .blend files using Git: "git clone <repo-link>"
3. Open Blend File: Launch Blender and open the ".blend" file from the cloned repository. Ensure all necessary Blender add-ons are enabled, such as the landscape and node wrangler add-ons.
4. Run the Simulation: Adjust any required simulation settings (e.g., fluid dynamics, particle system). Hit F12 to render the scene, or press Alt+A to run the simulation for visualization.
